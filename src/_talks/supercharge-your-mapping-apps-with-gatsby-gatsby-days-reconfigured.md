This talk walks through some real-world use cases on how adding a map to a project can help somsone's experience when using your app or website. I walk through some basics on how to get started building a map powered by Gatsby like my [Gatsby Starter for Leaflet](https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet) and my [React Leaflet Gatsby Recipe](https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-recipe-react-leaflet).
