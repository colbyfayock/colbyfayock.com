I caught up with Alex and Brittney over at [CodingCatDev](https://codingcat.dev/).

We talk about [Jamstack Handbook](https://jamstackhandbook.com/), what makes the Jamstack awesome, and how you can get started with it.

We also dive into some of the hot drama around WordPress and the Jamstack ðŸ”¥

CodingCatDev is also available on all the main podcast sites at Purrfect.dev.
