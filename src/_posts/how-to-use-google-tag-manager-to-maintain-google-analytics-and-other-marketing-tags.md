Managing code snippets and pixels on your website or app to measure traffic can be a little bit stressful, especially if you have a marketing team that constantly needs to make changes. Luckily, there are tools out there like Google Tag Manager that will make them a little easier to wrangle.

## What is Google Tag Manager?

If you‚Äôve ever worked with any kind of analytics software, or you have worked with a marketing team before, you‚Äôve probably heard the word pixel thrown around. A pixel is literally what it sounds like, a 1x1 image that sends information to a server through an image request.

![Google Analytics pixel request](/assets/google-analytics-pixel-request.jpg)

Though pixels are still common, many teams have moved towards small javascript snippets that sit right along side the rest of your HTML and will allow software like Google Analytics to run their own scripts on your page, sometimes even with a pixel backup in the event of a browser not running javascript.

![Crazy Egg tracking snippet](/assets/crazy-egg-tracking-snippet.jpg)

These pixels and snippets work great, but when you‚Äôre dealing with a bunch of them and they all use the same data, it might seem like you‚Äôre just adding to an unmanageable mess of single use code snippets that never feel like they‚Äôre in the right place.

Google Tag Manager, or GTM, is a software solution to manage these pixels and snippets for you. To start, GTM works pretty much like any of those other code snippets, as it‚Äôs a code snippet itself, but where it shines, is you get to manage the rest of those pixels and snippets along with the flow of data inside GTM, leaving it to be the only snippet to manage within your code.

## Why do I want to use it?

### Less code changes, less deploys

Most of the time, if you‚Äôre managing these snippets in your code, each change will require another merge request and another deploy to get the changes out. Not only does this add more risk as you need to make yet another change to the code, this is additional time spent dealing with your deploy pipeline and making sure everything is working as it should be. GTM allows you to break outside of that flow giving you more flexibility to get changes out that could give some needed insight to help fix some UI errors or add a few bucks to the bottom line.

### More manageable data flow

Wrangling all the different variables throughout your application, making sure they‚Äôre all available in the right spot, and keeping up with avoiding breaking any changes can prove to be challenging, making your code more fragile and prone to breaking. Google Tag Manager utilizes what they call a `dataLayer`, which essentially functions like an array of events that it listens to, that allows you to push or seed new data to make available within GTM itself. This means you‚Äôre funneling all of your variables to 1 spot in the code, letting whoever manages GTM do the rest by utilizing that data with peace of mind that your data flow won‚Äôt break after forgetting to update 1 out of 10 spots.

### Ability to give marketers a little more access

This is an opportunity to free up some of your time by letting the marketing team deal with tag changes themselves rather than you being the middle man for them. Perhaps they need to adjust the ID for your analytics software or maybe they want to add [Crazy Egg](https://www.crazyegg.com/). With the right permissions (explained later), they can do all of the work and send the changes to you for review before publishing them.

## How does this relate to Google Analytics?

There is no direct relation, but along with Google Analytics, GTM is another tool in the Google Marketing Platform and gives you immediate ability to more easily manage your Google Analytics installation. GA comes with prebuilt tags inside GTM that make it a breeze to set up.

## What else can I use this for?

Google Analytics is just one of many code snippets this can be used for. Ideally, you‚Äôre not going to write your entire site here, but you have the capability of pretty much doing whatever you want on your own site as long as [Google doesn‚Äôt deem it malware](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6328489?hl=en).

Some other use cases include:

* Traffic visualization with [Crazy Egg](https://www.crazyegg.com/) or [Hot Jar](https://www.hotjar.com/)
* Conversion and remarketing pixels with [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/)
* A/B Testing with [Google Optimize](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/) or [AB Tasty](https://www.abtasty.com/)
* [Client side error](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7679411?hl=en) tracking (and logging them)
* GDPR compliance management

There are many baked in like the examples above, meaning you don‚Äôt even need to mess with code, just add the IDs or settings and go, but for whatever custom solution or tag you need, you can always set up the HTML manually.

## Anything I need to know before jumping in?

Before jumping right in, let‚Äôs familiarize ourselves with a few key terms that will make this ride a little easier.

### Tags

Tags in GTM are your pixels or code snippets. A tag includes a single instance of a contained piece of code that is used for one function.

_Example:_ your Google Analytics snippet will be one tag and if you add Crazy Egg, that will be another tag.

### Variables

A variable is a name that you give a predetermined or dynamic value. The variable can be based on a variety of different things, hence the name ‚Äúvariable‚Äù, but this will function as a single name that you can give and reference that will never change when using it.

_Example:_ we‚Äôll set up your Google Analytics ID as a variable, meaning you‚Äôll use that variable within the GA tag itself. If you ever need to update that ID, you won‚Äôt need to modify the tag or any other tags that use the variable, you‚Äôll only need to update the variable itself.

### Triggers

Triggers are the event or action that make your tag fire or load. This can happen in a variety of ways, such as when all or a specific page loads, when something is clicked, or a [completely custom event](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7679219?hl=en) you fire with Javascript.

_Example:_ when we set up Google Analytics, our trigger will be when any page loads.

### Container

GTM allows you to manage multiple ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù or groups of tags within your organization. This is helpful when you have one company with a few different website properties.

_Example:_ you‚Äôre a small company under a parent company. The parent company wants to maintain one organization, but each smaller company gets their own container, as they have their individual needs for tags and code snippets.

## How do I get set up?

### Getting your account set up

The first thing you‚Äôll need to do is get your account set up. After wondering to the [tag manager homepage](https://tagmanager.google.com/), you‚Äôll probably want to use your preexisting Google account. If you‚Äôre in an organization setting it up for the organization, you most likely want to use your business email, otherwise your personal account works okay too.

Next, create a new GTM account:


![Google Tag Manager new account](/assets/google-tag-manager-new-account.jpg)

Once there, fill out the form appropriately. The Account Name should represent the top level of your hierarchy and the container name should represent the specific installation instance.


![Google Tag Manager new account container](/assets/google-tag-manager-new-account-container.jpg)

As for the target platform, choose whichever makes sense. If it‚Äôs a website or web app, Web makes the most sense here.

### Finding and installing your snippet

As soon as you accept the terms and hit create, you‚Äôll be presented with a snippet in a little modal. You'll want to do exactly what it says and install the snippets per the instructions.

![Google Tag Manager install snippet](/assets/google-tag-manager-install-snippet.jpg)

Didn‚Äôt get the screen or accidentally exited out? You can find your snippet again by navigating to Admin in the top navbar and then click Install Google Tag Manager under Container to the right. 

### Testing that it‚Äôs working

To make sure it‚Äôs working, let‚Äôs verify a few things:

* We created our account
* We created our container
* We installed the Google Tag Manager snippets on our page and the change are live

Once all of those things are true, go ahead and click the Preview button in the top right of the page.


![Google Tag Manager preview](/assets/google-tag-manager-preview.jpg)

If successful, you‚Äôll now see an orange banner at the top of the page that says you‚Äôre in Preview Mode:


![Google Tag Manager preview mode](/assets/google-tag-manager-preview-mode.jpg)

Now wander over to the website that you installed GTM on and you should now see a banner at the bottom of the page, which will serve as your Debugger for working with GTM‚Äôs Preview.

![Google Tag Manager debugger](/assets/google-tag-manager-debugger.jpg)

You should see something similar to that, which means it worked! üéâ

Note: if you have an ad blocker on, similar to GA, you may need to disable it on the page you‚Äôre installing on in order to see it working.

## Cool, it‚Äôs working, what about Google Analytics?

Now that we have a basic installation of GTM working, let‚Äôs set up Google Analytics. First we'll want to do some prep, so let's jump back over to the Tag Manager dashboard.

### Create a settings variable

Navigate to Variables in the left sidebar and then click New beside User-Defined Variables.

![Google Tag Manager new variable](/assets/google-tag-manager-new-variable.jpg)

For the name, enter ‚ÄúGA Settings‚Äù and under Variable Type, click through and select Google Analytics Settings. Enter your Google Analytics Tracking ID (or Property ID) in the appropriate field, and finally click Save, at which point you have your new settings variable.

### Create a new GA tag

Navigate to Tags in the left sidebar and then click New beside Tags.

![Google Tag Manager new tag](/assets/google-tag-manager-new-tag.jpg)

For the name, enter ‚ÄúGA - All Pages‚Äù and under Tag Type, click and select Google Analytics: Universal Analytics in the panel that pops out from the right. 

After selecting the tag type, under Google Analytics Settings, select your variable from the previous step, which if you followed along will be called ‚ÄúGA Settings‚Äù.

Next, click in the middle of the Triggering box, which should open a new UI to select a trigger.

![Google Tag Manager trigger](/assets/google-tag-manager-trigger.jpg)

Select All Pages, which should be the only Trigger there if you‚Äôre in a new account, which will take you back to the New Tag UI with your newly selected trigger.

Once the above is done, click Save in the top right of the UI which will then save and create your new Google Analytics tag.

### Test that GTM is working

Similar to when we installed GTM to begin with, let‚Äôs go back to the Workspace home, but clicking Overview in the left sidebar, and click Preview at the top right.

![Google Tag Manager debugger with Google Analytics](/assets/google-tag-manager-debugger-google-analytics.jpg)

Open up your page GTM is installed on and you should once again see your Debugger, but this time with the Google Analytics Tag loading.

## Are we done yet?

Not quite, though we have GA working, we need to tweak the configuration to make sure GA and GTM work right together.

### Updating the page snippet

Let‚Äôs dig into the code one more time to update our Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager snippets.

The issue with the installation that we set up here, is we installed GA through the GA instructions and GA inside GTM, which means we have GA installed twice. What will happen in practice, is GA may send 1 pageview from your default installation and then another via GTM. To avoid this, we want to remove the pageview from the default GA snippet.

If you just have a super basic default installation, I did the work for you and you can go ahead and copy the snippet below, replacing `[YOUR GA PROPERTY ID]` with your GA Property ID and `[YOUR GTM CONTAINER ID]` with your GTM Container ID, and swapping it out for your existing GA and GTM installation on your page.

```
<script>
// Set up an initial dataLayer configuration
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [{
  "gaPropertyId": "[YOUR GA PROPERTY ID]"
}];

// Configure gtag and your GA ID
function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
gtag('js', new Date());
gtag('config', '[YOUR GA PROPERTY ID]');

// Google Tag Manager snippet
(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl+'&gtm_cookies_win=x';f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
})(window,document,'script','dataLayer', '[YOUR GTM CONTAINER ID]');
</script>
```

This should REPLACE your current Google Analytics snippet if you have one. If you don't, this should go as far in the top of your `<head>` tag as you can, but under the `charset` meta tag.

For more advanced users, just make sure you‚Äôre not sending duplicate pageviews or duplicate events between the page snippet and any GTM tag you create.

### Test that GA is working

Follow the steps above to make sure GA is showing up with the debugger.

The final thing you‚Äôll want to do is make sure your installation is working using [Google‚Äôs Tag Assistant extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-by-google/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk?hl=en). Once you install the extension, go back to your page and click Enable in the Extension‚Äôs UI.

![Google Tag Assistant record](/assets/google-tag-assistant-record.jpg)

Refresh the page and you should see 2 tags, GA and GTM.

![Google Tag Assistant results](/assets/google-tag-assistant-results.jpg)

If you notice my GA tag is blue and yours may be too. Click in to Google Analytics for more info.

![Google Tag Assistant implementation](/assets/google-tag-assistant-implementation.jpg)

As you can see, we have a healthy 1 Pageview Request and a note that says Non-standard implementation, hence the blue, which is because we installed it with GTM instead of the default on page.

## Publish and Deploy!

We‚Äôre there! Last step is to Publish your Container and make the changes live. 


![Google Tag Manager submit](/assets/google-tag-manager-submit.jpg)

Click Submit in the Overview UI, enter a name and description.

![Google Tag Manager version configuration](/assets/google-tag-manager-version-configuration.jpg)

Finally click Publish and your changes will be live on your site!

## What else do I need to know?

There‚Äôs plenty more to talk through, but that‚Äôs for a different day. There are a ton of resources online to get you started with adding your own new tags and exploring the capabilities of Google Analytics, but here are a few points to keep in mind with GTM.

### Permissions

You most likely don‚Äôt want every marketer on your 1,000 person team to have publish access to your GTM container. It‚Äôs best to have one or a few people responsible for managing the container reviewing and publishing while keeping everyone to a lower access role. This will help prevent accidental changes or abuse within a bigger team.

### Security

Permissions are your first step towards maintaining a secure installation, but Google takes this an extra step and performs some actions for you such as checking for code errors and [scanning for malware](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6328489?hl=en). While this is great, it‚Äôs still important to keep an active review cycle of tags getting published just like any other pieces of code to make sure the site integrity and health is remaining in tact.

### Conventions

I highly recommend starting early with naming conventions and best practices when configuring your tags, variables, triggers, and really anything within GTM. The different ways to name things can spiral out of control really fast depending on how many people are working in there which will make your work difficult to find, so it‚Äôs best to agree with the team on a convention to use early and get off on the right foot.

### Single Page Apps

This doesn‚Äôt account for the impact single page apps have on a GTM and GA setup. The trigger we set up here will fire when any page loads, which is defined by a new page load by the browser. Single page apps don‚Äôt actually load a new page, rather, the javascript within the app makes it appear that a new page loads, so the trigger here will only fire the first pageview. Though it doesn‚Äôt include information directly usable in GTM, the GA documentation has [some good information](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/single-page-applications) about tracking these types of apps.

### GDPR

While GTM alone does not (currently) violate GDPR, you still need to be cognizant of how any of the tags you use impact your standing. This guide doesn‚Äôt touch this, so please make sure to do your homework.

### Exiting out of Debugger

Stuck? One way is to clear your cookies, but you should always be able to go to the GTM Overview page and hit "Leave Preview Mode‚Äù right under the orange Preview Mode banner at the top of the page.

## What's next?

From here, you can start managing your tags and pixels through GTM, allowing you to have a single source of consistent data flow into those tags. Experiment and use the debugger to play around as it opens the door for a lot of new ways to work with the marketing side of things.
