For a while I’ve sat on this idea of using the name Colbyashi Maru for some kind of fun content series.

## What the Colbyashi Maru?

If you missed the reference, Colbyashi Maru is a play on the [Kobayashi Maru](https://www.startrek.com/database_article/kobayashi-maru) from Star Trek, which is a training exercise presenting a “no win” scenario to [those taking the challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6tWmSckE40).

While I didn’t start getting into Star Trek until the newer movies (still want to go back and watch the series), I thought it was a fun concept that I could apply to the code world.

## Enter Colbyashi Maru

Colbyashi Maru is a new streaming series where I’ll bring on guests and put them in a somewhat no-win scenario, where I’ll give the guest 1 hour to build a project.

The project topic will be pre-determined, but the idea is the guest will join the stream, start a new project from scratch, and essentially see how far they can get within that hour.

## Starting Thursday January 14th

The first Colbyashi Maru will be on Thursday January 14th at 1pm EST.
