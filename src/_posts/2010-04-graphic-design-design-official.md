Design Official is a mock design team/company created by two colleagues and myself to emulate the structure and teamwork needed in a typical design team. Progressing throughout the time, projects focused on school oriented assignments. We completed various projects all dealing mostly with photography and graphic design.

With Design Official, I created a logo, a business card, and a company website (below) to demonstrate the branding of our team. Having an elegant, yet fun outlook, we wanted to keep along the lines of a professional identity as well as leaving a bit of fun personality to it.
