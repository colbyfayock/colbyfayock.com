<a title="View website for the movie Paper Heart" href="http://www.paperheart-movie.com/"><em>Paper Heart</em></a> is a film that was created to look like a documentary of a girl who does not believe in love. As the film progresses, she finds her way into romance and discovers love first hand.

This project was created in response to a <a title="View Paper Heart poster design competition details!" href="http://news.deviantart.com/article/85898/"> poster design competition</a> promoted by <a title="View website for Deviant Art" href="http://www.deviantart.com/">Deviant Art</a>. For this, I wanted to portray the feeling of the film as well as dive in to the literal feel to the name. With this design, I placed in the <a title="View top 25 semi-finalists for the Paper Heart poster design competition!" href="http://news.deviantart.com/article/88575/">top 25</a> of all that were submitted.
