[Paper Heart](http://www.paperheart-movie.com/) is a film that was created to look like a documentary of a girl who does not believe in love. As the film progresses, she finds her way into romance and discovers love first hand

This project was created in response to a [poster design competition](http://news.deviantart.com/article/85898/) promoted by [Deviant Art](http://www.deviantart.com/). For this, I wanted to portray the feeling of the film as well as dive in to the literal feel to the name. With this design, I placed in the [top 25](http://news.deviantart.com/article/88575/) of all that were submitted.
