Wowee Zowee was a student project that I created mocking the current fast food era. Many fast food chains will promote ridiculous food creations similar to the fake one shown.

The one in this particular promotion consists of simply a hamburger bun and cheese. Labeled "The Cheezow" to relate to the brand's name, this product was directly making fun of the Taco Bell "Cheese Roll-Up," which as you might have guessed is made up of a wrap with a simple cheese stuffing. I will give credit to Taco Bell, where their product has three separate cheeses, but mine only consists of one.
