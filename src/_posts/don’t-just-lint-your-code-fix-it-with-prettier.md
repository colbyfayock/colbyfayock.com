Linting makes everyone‚Äôs lives easier by telling us what‚Äôs wrong with our code, but how can we avoid doing the actual work that goes into fixing it?

[Previously I wrote about linting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-linting-and-how-can-it-save-you-time/), what it is, and how it makes your life easier. At the end, I actually included a way that you could automatically fix your code, so why am I writing this?

## What do you mean fix it?

Before we roll into it, let‚Äôs hit this quick. Linters are powerful and provide an easy way to scan your code for syntax errors that could lead to bugs or can simply help keep a codebase clean, healthy, and consistent. When ran, it will show all the issues and let you go through each one individually to fix it.

Taking that to the next level, some linters will actually allow you to pass in an argument to the command running the linter and allow it to fix it for you automagically. This means you don‚Äôt have to manually go through and make all of those little whitespace and semicolon (add them! üî•) tweaks yourself!

## So what more can I do to fix things?

If you already use the fix option, thats a good start, but there are tools out there that have been developed specifically to tackle this problem beyond just a flag into your command. The one I‚Äôm going to cover is Prettier.

## What is Prettier?

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) pegs itself as ‚Äúan opinionated code formatter." It takes an input of your code and outputs it in a consistent format stripping any of the original code style. It actually converts your code to a [syntax tree](https://github.com/benjamn/recast), then rewrites it using the styles and rules you and Prettier provide together via your ESLint config and Prettier‚Äôs default rules.

You can easily use Prettier alone just to format your code, which works just fine, but combine this with an underlying ESLint process and you get both a powerful linter and a powerful fixer. I‚Äôm going to show you how to make those work together.

## Getting started

For this walkthrough, I‚Äôm going to assume that you have ESLint set up and configured in an application. Particularly, I‚Äôm going to pick up where I left off in my previous walkthrough where [we installed ESLint to a React application](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-linting-and-how-can-it-save-you-time/).

Additionally of note, Prettier tells us right from the start, it's an opinionated code formatter. You should expect that it will format your code in  a consistent, but maybe different way, than you currently have it configured to. But don‚Äôt fret! You can tweak this configuration.

So what are we starting off with? We already:

* Have installed [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
* Have added [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) as our parser
* Added a [plugin](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) that includes React configurations

Next, let‚Äôs get started by installing a few packages:

```
yarn add prettier prettier-eslint prettier-eslint-cli -D
```

_Note: the command above is similar to using `npm`. If your project doesn't use `yarn`, swap out to `npm` as appropriate._

Above, we‚Äôre installing:

* [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): core Prettier package and engine
* [prettier-lint](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint): passes the Prettier result to ESLint to fix using your ESLint config
* [prettier-eslint-cli](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint-cli): helps Prettier and ESLint work together on various files across your project
  And we‚Äôre installing them as a dev dependency, as we don‚Äôt need it outside development.

## Configuring your new formatter

Now that our packages are installed, we can set up `yarn` to run this command for us.

Previously, we set up a `lint` script to look like this in our `package.json`:

```
‚Äúscripts‚Äù: {
  ‚Ä¶
  ‚Äúlint‚Äù: ‚Äúeslint . ‚Äîext .js‚Äù,
  ‚Ä¶
}
```

We‚Äôre going to leave that as it is, but we‚Äôll do something similar and create a new script right next to it called `format` for our formatter Prettier:

```
‚Äúscripts‚Äù: {
  ‚Ä¶
  ‚Äúformat‚Äù: ‚Äúprettier-eslint ‚Äîeslint-config-path ./.eslintrc.js --write '**/*.js‚Äô‚Äù,
  ‚Äúlint‚Äù: ‚Äúeslint . ‚Äîext .js‚Äù,
  ‚Ä¶
}
```

So what‚Äôs going on there? We‚Äôre:

* Adding a new script called `format`, that we can run as `yarn format`
* We‚Äôre utilizing our `prettier-eslint-cli` package to run the formatting for us
* We‚Äôre passing in our ESLint config located next to our `package.json` in the root of the project (change this if it‚Äôs in a different location)
* And finally, we‚Äôre telling prettier to write all files matching `**/*.js`, or any JS files it finds recursively through our project

## Run your formatter!

Now that we‚Äôre all set up, let‚Äôs run it! Run this following:

```
yarn format
```

and immediately, we see that it works:

## Hey, my code looks different!

As I mentioned earlier, Prettier tells us straight up, it‚Äôs an opinionated formatter. It ships with it‚Äôs own rules, sort of like it‚Äôs own ESLint config, so it will go through and make those changes as well.

Don‚Äôt abandon your code! Instead, you can review the changes, see if maybe it makes sense to keep it that way (it will be very consistent) or you can update your ESLint config (`.eslintrc.js`) to overwrite the rules you don‚Äôt like. This is also a good way to maybe learn some new things that you might not have expected to get caught before.

## So where does this leave us?

If you‚Äôve followed along so far, we now have two commands:

* `lint`: which will check your code for you and tell you what's wrong
* `format`: will automatically try to fix the problems for you

When using these in practice, your best bet is to always run `format` first to let it try to automatically fix anything it can, then immediate run `lint`, to catch anything Prettier wasn‚Äôt able to fix automatically.

## What‚Äôs next?

Now that we can format our code automatically, we should be able to automatically fix our code automatically!

Next time we‚Äôll take this a step further and set up a `git` hook that will allow this to run before you commit, making you not have to ever worry about forgetting to run this again!
