To promote her company and get a foot in the door, I was asked by my mom to make a website for [Hair by Diane](http://www.hairbydianemfn.com). I wanted to create a modern look to the site yet keep the charm that her shop has.

The layout is simple, but effective bringing together all of the information in a way that is direct and easy to communicate. Bringing in two photos from [iStockphoto](http://www.istockphoto.com), the background flower and model, I created the stacks below to display the text. Supplementing the site is a featured blog that will eventually grow into a wealth of information written by Diane dealing with hair and beauty.
