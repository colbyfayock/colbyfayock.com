I‚Äôm proud to officially launch my first ebook [50 Projects for React & the Static Web](https://50reactprojects.com/).

<figure><img src="/assets/cover.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Ebook Cover</figcaption></figure>

This free ebook includes 50 project ideas complete with project briefs, a layout idea, and resources if you get stuck.

I fully believe the best way to learn is by doing and this can help you stop asking yourself ‚Äúwhat should I build?‚Äù and instead dive right in and get started.

Thank you to all for your support and feedback as well as my wife for bearing with me while I was heads down working on this. ‚ô•Ô∏è
