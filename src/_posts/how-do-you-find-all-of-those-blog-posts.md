I'm pretty active on [Slack](https://slack.com/) (most active, ahem...). I like to chat, because I believe strong communication is super helpful for teams, but it’s also a lot of fun (gifs, memes, etc).

![Man saying "shhh"](https://i.giphy.com/media/NdKVEei95yvIY/giphy.webp)

Straddling that line, I post articles I come across in relevant channels that I think others would appreciate or learn from, and typically they do. Often, I get asked where I find all of these blog posts…

No, I don’t follow all of those random developers. There’s a crazy amount of talented people out there, but luckily, there are other people already taking the time to aggregate all of this awesome content.

This isn’t a complete list, but should get the job done.

P.S. If you like any of these, be sure to look if they have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) or something similar and throw them a dollar or $2 a month for their effort. :)
