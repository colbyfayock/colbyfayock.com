If you’ve been following along with my work, I tend to talk about maps every so often.

This includes tutorials like [how to create a Coronavirus (COVID-19) statistics map](https://www.colbyfayock.com/2020/03/how-to-create-a-coronavirus-covid-19-dashboard-map-app-with-gatsby-and-leaflet/) or even [how to create your own Santa Tracker](https://www.colbyfayock.com/2019/12/create-your-own-santa-tracker-with-gatsby-and-react-leaflet/).

tl;dr my new course Building Maps with React Leaflet is now available on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io?af=atzgap)!

## Why so much about maps?
While maps aren’t my sole focus for the educational content I create, I’ve developed a passion for maps with my work at [Element 84](http://element84.com/).

With my day job, I’ve been working on building a satellite tasking dashboard, but before I even got started, I learned about how maps have made a huge impact in people’s lives at [State of the Map](https://2018.stateofthemap.us/). The stories are both inspiring and heartbreaking.

As I learned more about maps, the more I realized the learning curve isn’t quite what people would expect. While there’s absolutely some complexity as you start digging deep into maps, getting started with a basic map has a much lower barrier to entry thanks to the tools available to use like [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/en/).

## Learning maps with my new course!
That’s what led me to put my time into developing this Building Maps with React Leaflet course with the [egghead.io](https://egghead.io?af=atzgap) team.

I walk you through building a map from scratch, starting off with essentially a clone version of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) with a few tweaks to make it easier to focus on learning about maps.

Here’s what you’ll learn:
* How to build a map from scratch in a React app
* How to add markers and shapes to a map
* About geospatial data formats and how to create your own
* How to wrangle that data and visualize that data on a map
* How to use geolocation features to personalize the map
* How to customize the map with imagery and custom markers

After completing this course, you’ll be ready to build maps into your React apps for a ton of use cases, whether it’s visualizing geographical data like a pandemic or adding a store locator to your company’s website.

I’d love for you to take this journey with me and I’d love to hear any feedback.

## On a personal note, this is my first course!
Thanks to the egghead.io team for all the support through this process. Working through my first course was challenging, but it was certainly rewarding.

I hope you all enjoy learning maps with my course as much as I enjoyed putting it together.
