Potentially gearing up for a larger event, I was contacted to do a concept design for a flyer that would serve as a marketing effort for a water pong tournament. The tournament would have been a non-profit event benefiting the local university's baseball team. Though this event never was put into action, the end result turned out to be well liked and a good solution to the given request.
