[Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) is a powerful web service that gives you insights into your website or application. What exactly is it and how can it help?

I‚Äôm going to cover a few things here. If you‚Äôre already familiar with the basics, feel free to skip through:

* What is Google Analytics? (Overview)
* Okay, so where do I start? (Quick start install guide)
* What are some quick insights? (Basic out of the box reports)
* Bonus: Advanced Insights (Custom Dimensions)

So let‚Äôs start from the top.

## What is Google Analytics?

> Google Analytics gives you the tools you need to better understand your customers. You can then use those business insights to take action, such as improving your website, creating tailored audience lists, and more.

More simply put, Google Analytics (GA) is a web analytics service provided by Google on the [Google Marketing Platform](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/) that allows you to track and measure your website or application‚Äôs traffic with powerful insights and reports. GA can work a few different ways, but the most common is [using a quick drop-in Javascript snippet](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en) that goes on every page of your website (typically the `<head>`).

![Google Analytics lets you measure user interaction with websites or web apps.](/assets/google-analytics.png)

The base version of Google Analytics is free. You have the option of upgrading to the 360 suite, which will open up some feature limits, but most of you probably don‚Äôt need this and is more geared towards high traffic websites.

### Why do I need Google Analytics?

You don‚Äôt _need_ it, but the amount of insights you get even with an out of the box setup can be powerful for a developer trying to get more traffic to their blog or a business trying to optimize their funnel. Doing so allows you to answer some simple questions such as:

* Where is my traffic coming from?
* What pages get the most traffic?
* What are the most popular devices people visit on?

Not only can this help you make better educated decisions with your website, it can also help you unveil user experience concerns or save money due to site issues by keeping an eye on traffic trends and user interactions.

## Okay, so where do I start?

Google makes it‚Äôs fairly easy for any developer to jump in and get started. The only real prerequisite is that you set up an account. Google themselves offers a great [step-by-step and constantly updated guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en), so I‚Äôll leave it to them.

### Getting the tag on your page

Once you‚Äôre logged in and at the Google Analytics Dashboard, find yourself to the Admin section, which you can find on the left hand side of the page:

![Admin link in the Google Analytics Dashboard](/assets/google-analytics-admin.jpg)

Once in the admin section, you can navigate to Tracking Info then Tracking code under the property you want to track.

![Tracking code link in the Google Analytics Admin ](/assets/google-analytics-admin-tracking.jpg)

Finally, you can find the Javascript snippet that you can throw in the head of your application or website. Remember, this should be on ALL pages!

### Let the traffic flow

From here you just have to give it time. Google Analytics won‚Äôt have historical data, it will only have the the new traffic that hit your page once the snippet was installed. You can check it‚Äôs working by visiting the Realtime Report and either hitting the page in another tab or seeing your visitors hit the page.

### More settings, more configuration

Google Analytics is a complex machine and can do a lot! Start slow and try to understand what‚Äôs happening before moving too fast turning every different switch. Once comfortable, there are a lot of [great guides out there](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+analytics+tips) for beginners and advanced users alike to unleash the full power of your reporting capabilities.

## What are some quick insights?

Cool, so you have GA installed, you see your traffic, and you‚Äôre ready to get started looking at your reports, but where to begin?

### What pages get the most traffic?

Let‚Äôs start with a simple one. Which pages of my site or application are getting the most traffic? To find this out we‚Äôll want to view the Behavior Overview, which we can find by visiting Behavior then Overview.

![Finding top page on Google Analytics Behavior Overview Report](/assets/google-analytics-behavior-overview.jpg)

Above we‚Äôre looking at the full month of August, which you can change with the date picker in the top right of the report. We can see overall, we had 3,853,265 total pageviews and 121,187 of them were to /news, the freeCodeCamp News homepage, which was our most popular page of the month!

### Where is my traffic coming from?

A common question is: ‚Äúwhere are people coming from?‚Äù How are people actually finding my website? This is a 2 parter, let‚Äôs start with overall traffic. 

A good way to start is by finding the Acquisition Overview page. You can navigate there by selecting Acquisition than Overview.

![Finding top traffic source on Google Analytics Acquisition Overview Report](/assets/google-analytics-acquisition-overview.jpg)

Shown above, the majority of traffic comes from organic searches on Google, a little over 75% in fact. That‚Äôs some good [SEO](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo)!

![Outstanding Move](/assets/outsanding-move.jpg)

But what if we wanted to see how people are getting to a particular post? This involves a little more work, but let‚Äôs dive in.

Let‚Äôs go back to Behavior in the sidebar, then Site Content, and finally Landing Pages. Once there, you can use the search to find your post as shown below and select it.

![Searching for a page on the Google Analytics Landing Page Report](/assets/google-analytics-landing-page-search.jpg)

After you found your post, we‚Äôre going to add a Secondary dimension, In particular, we‚Äôll want to find and select ‚ÄúSource / Medium‚Äù in the Secondary dimension dropdown.

![Adding a Secondary dimension on the Google Analytics Landing Page Report](/assets/google-analytics-landing-page-secondary-dimension.jpg)

Finally we‚Äôll have an idea of where people are coming from to visit our post. 

![Finding the top Source / Medium on the Google Analytics Landing Page Report](/assets/google-analytics-landing-page-top-source-medium.jpg)

Seems like this is following the trend of great Organic SEO. If you notice though, we have ‚Äú(direct) / (none)‚Äù as the second highest source / medium. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not always that easy and if Google Analytics can‚Äôt figure out where the user came from, it will mark it as ‚Äú(direct) / (none)‚Äù. [While that‚Äôs solvable](https://moz.com/blog/guide-to-direct-traffic-google-analytics), and sometimes actually means something, we can see the majority comes from simple searches on Google itself.

### What are the most popular devices people visit on?

Understanding what devices your visitors are using is an incredibly helpful tool for optimizing User Experience as well as maximizing potential revenue by making sure your site works! While it‚Äôs encouraged to make sure your website or app works on all browsers, we may be able to safely rule out certain older browsers.

![Internet Explorer behind a tree](/assets/ie-behind-tree.jpg)

To get started, find your way to Audience then Overview. Once there, select Browsers in the list as shown below.

![Finding the top browser in the Google Analytics Acquisition Report](/assets/google-analytics-acquisition-top-browser.jpg)

We can see that luckily, our top browsers are dominated by modern ones, with Chrome carrying a cool 76.42%! But wait, Internet Explorer is pulling 1.06% or 22,499, which isn‚Äôt something to bat an eye at. So let‚Äôs dig in a little more by clicking on Internet Explorer.

![Finding the traffic for Internet Explorer versions in the Google Analytics Acquisition Browser Report](/assets/google-analytics-acquisition-browser-internet-explorer.jpg)

Phew, I think we‚Äôre safe. Now we can see how many people visit each version of Internet Explorer and luckily almost 99% of THAT traffic is IE9 or above. While it‚Äôs important that we should be as inclusive with development as we possibly can, this can help us determine priority and make decisions on [what browser versions to officially support](https://caniuse.com).

Real talk: 5 people on IE5? ü§î

## Bonus: Advanced Insights

Out of the box, Google Analytics is powerful, but with some customization and deeper integration with your web data, you can give your analytics dashboard extra superpowers.

## Custom Dimensions

[Custom Dimensions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709829?hl=en) are what Google specifies as ‚Äúnon-standard data‚Äù. Really, they‚Äôre just additional data points that we can configure to get a better understanding of what makes our website or app unique.

For the sake of this article (maybe a later one), I‚Äôm not going to go into how to add Custom Dimensions, but Google provides a [great guide to get an in depth understanding](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828?hl=en) and a [developer guide to go with it](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/custom-dims-mets). What I‚Äôll go over here is how to explore our reports once some Custom Dimensions are already set up.

### What are our Custom Dimensions?

To start, we‚Äôll talk about 2 specific Custom Dimensions: Author and Page Category. Author is what it sounds like, it‚Äôs the person who wrote the article. Page Category in our case is the primary, top-level category that represents the post. On freeCodeCamp News, you can specify as many categories as you want (do so responsibly), but the first one in the list is consider your ‚Äúprimary‚Äù category and is used when you see your post in listing views such as the homepage.

![Post on freeCodeCamp News Homepage](/assets/freecodecamp.org-news-list.jpg)

### What can we do with these?

The great thing is when we set these up, we attribute them to a page view. Once that page view is collected by Google Analytics, we can use it to search on, which is really what makes it powerful. Let‚Äôs start with Author.

### Finding all posts from a specific Author

If we wanted to search for any post written by Quincy Larson, we‚Äôll want to navigate back to Behavior, then Site Content, and finally All Pages. Once there, we‚Äôll want to add a Secondary dimension, similar when we added Source / medium, but now we‚Äôll want to search for and select Author, which you‚Äôll also find nested under the Custom Dimensions heading of that dropdown.

![Selecting Author as a Secondary dimension on the Google Analytics Behavior Report](/assets/google-analytics-pages-secondary-dimension.jpg)

From there, we‚Äôll want to select Advanced on the right (highlighted below),  add our author‚Äôs name, and finally hit the Apply button.

![Searching for an Author in Advanced Search of Google Analytics Behavior Report](/assets/google-analytics-pages-advanced-search.jpg)

After hitting apply, we now have all the stats we could ever dream of for the articles written by our author, Quincy Larson.

![All posts from an Author in Google Analytics Behavior Report](/assets/google-analytics-author-posts.jpg)

### What categories are doing the best?

This is a trickier one. There are a lot of questions we may be able to answer with the basic reports like we did with Author, such as ‚Äúout of all of the javascript posts, what has the most traffic?‚Äù, but maybe we want to know generally what category is the most popular on the site.

To do this we need to get our hands dirty with Custom Reports. This is too advanced to try to tackle in this post, but [Google does a great job at outlining it in detail](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1151300?hl=en).

For now, I‚Äôve done you a favor and set up a report that you can easily import to your account and use right away. So first thing‚Äôs first, let‚Äôs import the report:  https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/template?uid=4fHol2S_TZqcQACAwfcmfg

![Importing a Custom Report in Google Analytics](/assets/google-analytics-custom-report-import.jpg)

Here you should see a screen like the above that asks us 2 things: where should we apply the report and what do we want to call it? If you‚Äôre an author of freecodecamp.org with access to GA and want to view this, you would select the All Web Site Data view under the freeCodeCamp News property.

![Selecting a Property and View when importing a Custom Report in Google Analytics](/assets/google-analytics-import-property-selection.jpg)

Once selected, name the report what you‚Äôd like, such as ‚ÄúTop Primary Categories‚Äù, and click Create.

![Custom Report showing top Primary Categories in Google Analytics](/assets/google-analytics-custom-report-top-categories.jpg)

After it‚Äôs done, you‚Äôll then land on the newly imported custom report where you can immediately see the most popular categories on the site, which for August is Javascript!

## Breakdown

This was a lot!

![Alan Rickman in Galaxy Quest sinking in chair](/assets/galaxy-quest-alan-rickman-tired.gif)

But this is just the tip of the data iceberg. Even with just the above, you can see there‚Äôs a lot going on and a lot of configuration to make the most out of Google Analytics for your specific needs.

If this interests you, I encourage you to do some research on your own, [add a new view](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009714?hl=en) (particularly [a Test View](https://www.e-nor.com/blog/google-analytics/best-practices-views-google-analytics) to play around with), and get your hands dirty poking around the different reports. Otherwise, keep an eye out for more of my GA posts covering advanced installation and deeper insights.
