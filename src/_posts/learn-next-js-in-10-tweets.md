In the #jamstack world, Next.js pulled a hefty 58.6% share of framework adoption in 2020

Compared to other popular React.js frameworks like Gatsby, which pulled in 12%

The easiest way to get started with a new Next.js app is with Create Next App

Simply run:

```
yarn create next-app
```

or

```
npx create-next-app
```

You can even start from a git-based template with the -e flag

```
yarn create next-appÂ  -e https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-sass-starter
```

## 5. Next.js Routing

![](/assets/5.-routing.jpg)

Next.js uses a file-system based router

Meaning the files you create and their names, are what's used to create your website pages

```
/pages/index.js
\=> / (homepage)

/pages/about.js
\=> /about (About)
```

You can also add dynamic routes for more complex apps

## 6. Next.js was built on Server Side Rendering

![](/assets/6.-ssr.jpg)

The foundation of Next.js comesÂ  from SSR

SSR = Server Side Rendering

On each browser request, Next.js renders the React pageÂ  and serves the HTML to the browser

If any data is needed, `getServerSideProps` can be used to fetch dynamic data during render

## 7. Next.js supports statically generating apps

It's also capable of SSG

SSG = Static Site Generation

`next export` takes the Next.js website, renders the project similar to how it would on the server, and saves it as static files and assets

`getStaticProps` allows you to fetch data at build time
