Mannings is a TV, furniture, and appliances store owned and managed by my grandfather. He has had this store for over 50 years and has never owned a business card. I figured it was about time he got one!

For his card, I was debating having his face and portrait as the back, but figured the front of his building with his company name on it would match his taste a little better. With that, I took his current company logo, freshened it up a bit, and provided his requested information finally ending with his locally known slogan, "Cross over the bridge!"

Next, I'm hoping I can help him understand the potential expansion with having his name on the web!
