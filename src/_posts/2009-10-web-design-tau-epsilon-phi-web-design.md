The <a title="View the website for the Pennsylvania State University" href="http://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a> branch of <a title="View website for Tau Epsilon Phi" href="http://www.tephq.org/">Tau Epsilon Phi</a> requested me to create a website for their brotherhood.

For this project, I created a website based upon their fraternity color, purple, and presented a clear and easy to use theme and navigation structure. More recently, their fraternity has merged with another, making this design a piece not in use.
