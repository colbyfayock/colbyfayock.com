The [Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu/) branch of [Tau Epsilon Phi](http://www.tephq.org/) requested me to create a website for their brotherhood.

For this project, I created a website based upon their fraternity color, purple, and presented a clear and easy to use theme and navigation structure. More recently, their fraternity has merged with another, making this design a piece not in use.
