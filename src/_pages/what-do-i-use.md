Content creation is an area that I've only relatively recently started to explore. Being able to create engaging, educational content that helps others learn has been super rewarding and I've even written about [how others can overcome their fear of writing](https://www.colbyfayock.com/2020/04/overcoming-your-fear-of-writing-and-how-you-can-find-motivation/).

Part of content creation is delivering on different mediums, trying to provide as high quality as possible, and allowing learners to focus on the content itself, rather than the noise in the background. While you can get pretty far with the onboard mic and webcam, it's really limiting in the quality you can achieve.

I can't promise that what I use will give you [as professional as a look as Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/dSLR-webcam-for-live-streaming) from [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/?af=atzgap), but the equipment I use was chosen as a way to clearly level up the quality of my audio and video without breaking the bank.

I would consider my setup "budget" friendly, but that's relative to the high cost this kind of equipment can typically run when trying to outfit your own setup. I've been fortunate that I've been able to afford the equipment I have, receive a mic as an [egghead.io instructor](https://egghead.io/instructors/colby-fayock?af=atzgap), and reinvest my earnings from my lessons and courses into upgrading my equipment.

I also want to point out that just because you see me or other content creators using particular equipment, doesn't mean you should rush out to buy it right away. I took some time before upgrading my equipment, starting out with a [$16 iOS app](https://obs.camera/) that allowed me to record video with my phone to [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). Make sure you're in this for the long haul before investing in it.

That said, here's the equipment I've been using to create [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/colbyfayock), [lessons and courses on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/colby-fayock?af=atzgap), and various other bits and pieces I use the equipment with. Reach out on Twitter if you have any specific questions and I can try to answer as best as I can, or at a minimum, help you try to figure it out.

## Audio

Audio is arguably the most important piece of the content creation puzzle. When delivering video, podcasts, or any other sound-based educational content, you want to be able to communicate as clearly as you can so your listeners and viewers can understand every concept you're trying to convey.

I was lucky to [receive an audio kit](https://twitter.com/colbyfayock/status/1277951605250428928) from [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/?af=atzgap) as an instructor.

They provide a [Shure BETA 87A](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Supercardioid-Condenser-Microphone-Applications/dp/B0002BACBO/?tag=fay-uses-20), [Focusrite Scarlett USB](https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B07QR6Z1JB/?tag=fay-uses-20) audio interface which is a preamp that connects between a microphone and your computer, some nice cables, a great tabletop stand, and a few other accessories (not to mention some stickers and [Badass: Making Users Awesome](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019/?tag=fay-uses-20)).

Before my egghead.io journey, I used a [Blue Yeti](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N1YPXW2/?tag=fay-uses-20), which worked really well, and is an extremely popular option for people getting into content creation. I used a Blue yeti when [recording a podcast with That's My JAMstack](https://thatsmyjamstack.com/posts/colby-fayock/).
