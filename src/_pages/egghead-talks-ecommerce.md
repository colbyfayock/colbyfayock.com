## Course: Create an eCommerce Store with Next.js and Stripe Checkout

[![Ecommerce Course on egghead.io](/assets/card_2x.jpg)](https://egghead.io/projects/create-an-ecommerce-store-with-next-js-and-stripe-checkout?af=atzgap&utm_source=colbyfayock.com&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=thejamdev2021_talk_page)

Ecommerce is a powerful way to sell products online whether it's tshirts or an ebook.

In this egghead.io course, I walk through building an online store from scratch using Next.js and Stripe Checkout.

We'll walk through React core fundamentals like the useState React hook and Context API to build a global cart that sends customers to check out.

## Journey to Dev

[![Sign up for free!](/assets/open-graph.jpg)](https://journeyto.dev/)

As an educator, part of my goal is to create content that helps others learn new tools through tutorials, walkthroughs, videos, courses, and really any medium I can use.‚Äã

But none of those tutorials include the soft skills beyond code that are important to a career, like how to communicate with a team or how to figure out how you learn best.

This free 7-week newsletter helps you learn the human-oriented skills that you don't learn through tutorials like:

* How do I learn best?
* How do I ask the right questions?
* How can I become a good communicator?
* How can I better position myself to find a job?
* How can I set myself up for success?
