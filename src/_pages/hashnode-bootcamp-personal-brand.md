## Journey to Dev

[![Sign up for free!](/assets/open-graph.jpg)](https://journeyto.dev/)

As an educator, part of my goal is to create content that helps others learn new tools through tutorials, walkthroughs, videos, courses, and really any medium I can use.​

But none of those tutorials include the soft skills beyond code that are important to a career, like how to communicate with a team or how to figure out how you learn best.

This free 7-week newsletter helps you learn the human-oriented skills that you don't learn through tutorials like:

* How do I learn best?
* How do I ask the right questions?
* How can I become a good communicator?
* How can I better position myself to find a job?
* How can I set myself up for success?
