Julia Evans wrote about why it's important to keep a [brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/). The idea is, as you continue to grow and work through your career, you're going to have achievments that have helped you get to where you are.

These achievements can easily go unnoticed, whether it's your employer not realizing the work you've done or you forgot about some of the cool work you've done when talking about your work.

My hope here is to set an example and proudly show some of the work I've done to get to where I am.
